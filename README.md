# To Explain Why...
_when your servers go bazerk and your clients freak out because their apps arent working it is helpful to ensure them that everything is ok, the servers are just down for management_

## How it works
- The application saves a message on a per project bases so each project has only one message.
- The message can be edited via the control panel, you can activate the messages and use them however you want in your apps
- The best thing about this service is that it is a microservice... it does not depend on mission critical applications so this service should always be available to lean on
